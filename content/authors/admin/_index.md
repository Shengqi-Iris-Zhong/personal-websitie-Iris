Hi! My name is Shengqi Zhong 钟圣祺 (she/her), and I go by Iris. I am an incoming Master's student at the Stanford Education Data Science program. I aspire to improve education through quantitative methods, and my current interests lie in longitudinal data analyses and psychometrics. 

I graduated from Smith College in May 2021, with a degree in Psychology and Quantitative Economics. At Smith, my main focuses were developmental psychology and language acquisition.
